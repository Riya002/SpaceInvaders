Gagannaut Anand wants to go to moon in a Chandravahan.But Chandravahan object destroyer beam is damaged so the harmful objects need to be avoided at all costs to keep Gagannaut Anand safe and hopes of a brightfuture alive. You are working in the Control and Operationalteam of ISRO which regulates Satellite's launch,reorbiting,disposal,etc.You need to perform certain checks to make Chandravahan decipher the shortest possible path between two satellites and to avoid any possible orbital debris collision. Chandravahan is fast enough to treat special obstacles i.e. asteroids, meteoroids, comets, etc as stationary objects. But you will need to take in account relativistic effects.
